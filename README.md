**Online Resume Builder Using Java**

A resume or a CV is a document that lists your work experience, education, skills, and hobbies. I have tried to build a Resume Maker in Java using Apache POI API.

**Working-**

This project makes use of Apache POI API to edit the doc file.
i.e-Resume templates. I have currently made two resume templates which are available in the zip file of the project. The application takes inputs from the user and makes use of the API to replace a set of keywords in the selected template and then saves the resume by the name of the user. 

For example- if the name of the user is Polishettivamshi, then the file will be saved by the name- Polishettivamshi -cv.doc
Platform Used-I have made this application in the NetBeans IDE.
